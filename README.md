# Presentation-on-Textual-Feature-Analysis-and-Classification-Method-for-the-Plant-Disease-Detection

**Discription:** The thesis focuses on the development of a plant disease detection system using textual feature analysis and classification methods. The author explores different approaches for extracting relevant features from textual data, such as disease symptoms and plant characteristics, and using them to train machine learning models for disease classification. The aim of this work is to provide a fast and accurate way to detect plant diseases, which can help farmers identify and treat crop diseases early on, leading to increased crop yield and quality.
